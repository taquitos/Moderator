Do you have a Chrome extension that keeps installing and updating itself that you'd rather not have? Time to moderate it!

It's as easy as:
```
python3 moderate.py "Extension Name"
```

And in no time that extension will no longer be working or self-updating/self-repairing. This script locks the specific extension folder so that no automated process can install a new version.

What your extensions look like before:

## How it works
- The script looks for an `Extensions` folder in your `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default` path.
- It iterates through each folder looking for `manifest.json` 
- Determines the current extension's name and checks if it's a match (sometimes requiring a dive into the `messages.json`)
- Once a match is found, it locks the extension root using `chflags` to prevent updates from Chrome.
- Checks the manifest for all associated script files
- Overwrites the contents of each script file with `console.log("No thank you")`

### Note
I'm not a Python programmer, and I didn't spend much time on this so it's most likely trash üóë

I did test it on a couple computers a few different extensions, though üòÅ
